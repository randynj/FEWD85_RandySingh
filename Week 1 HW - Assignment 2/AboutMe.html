	About Me
</h3>

<section>
<p>
The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcee) sharing a house in Miami, Florida.
</p>

<p>The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorc√©e Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).</p> 

<p>They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5]</p>

<p>The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>
